# Introduction

Astro forms ship with some utility functions to handle forms.
Some functionality works by sending the script to the client and running it there.

You can access them via `Astro.locals.forms`.

### Controllers

```ts
class FormsReact {
    scriptToRun: string;
    overrideResponse: Response | null;

    // server side redirect
    redirect(location: string, status?: ValidRedirectStatus): void;
    updateSearchParams(): {
        search: URLSearchParams;
        redirect(status?: ValidRedirectStatus): void;
    };
    updateOneSearchParam(key: string, value?: string, status?: ValidRedirectStatus): void;

    /**
     * Reload the page with the current state (BindForm) without client redirect. If that a POST request, buttons will not be invoked again.
     * @param immediate true by default - If true, will stop rendering all BindForm components and their children and immediately reload the page.
     */
    reloadState(immediate: boolean = true): void;

    // client side redirect
    redirectTimeoutSeconds(location: string, timeoutSec = 2): void;

    alert(message: string): void;
    consoleLog(...messages: any[]): void;
    console(type: keyof Console, ...messages: any[]): void;
    callFunction(func: string, ...args: any[]): void;
}
```

### Example

```astro
---
import { Bind, BindForm, BButton, BInput } from "@astro-utils/forms/forms.js";
import Layout from "../layouts/Layout.astro";

type Form = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

const form = Bind<Form>();

let showSubmitText: string;
function formSubmit(){
    showSubmitText = `You name is ${form.name}, you are ${form.age} years old. `;

    // Redirect to home page after 2 seconds
    Astro.locals.forms.redirectTimeoutSeconds('/');
}
---
<Layout>
    <BindForm bind={form}>
        {showSubmitText}

        <h4>What you name*</h4>
        <BInput type="text" name="name" maxlength={20} required/>

        <h4>Enter age*</h4>
        <BInput type="int" name="age" min={10} required/>

        <BButton onClick={formSubmit} whenFormOK>Submit</BButton>
    </BindForm>
</Layout>
```

### Throw Response
If you want to throw a response from the server.

Meaning you in a nested function and you encore an error and you want to override an response and abort the current page execution.

You can use the `ThrowOverrideResponse` class.

```ts
new ThrowOverrideResponse(response?: Response, message?: string)
```

#### Example
```ts
import { ThrowOverrideResponse } from '@astro-utils/forms/forms.js';

throw new ThrowOverrideResponse(new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 }));
```

Edge case:
- If no `Response` is provided, will be use the response stored in `locals.forms.overrideResponse`.
- If no `Response` is stored in `locals.forms.overrideResponse`, will be return the message with error code 500.

#### Edge case example
```ts
import { ThrowOverrideResponse } from '@astro-utils/forms/forms.js';

Astro.locals.forms.redirect('/login');
throw new ThrowOverrideResponse();
```

Or you can just pass an error message:
```ts
throw new ThrowOverrideResponse(null, 'Unauthorized');
```
